# Moodle Code Editor
Moodle Code Editor plugin as part of my bachelor thesis at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria.

This repo provides two plugins to Moodle.
The `monaco` plugin adds the Monaco Editor to Moodle, to be used by plugins, developers and users.
The `code` plugin, provides a new question type for quizzes, to add the ability to ask coding questions in a quiz.
